            GT81 connects to your heart-rate monitor over Bluetooth to be able
            to measure your heart rate and calculate the amount of calories
            burned and grit points earned based on your gender, age, and weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            All measurement and calculation happens locally and no data is sent
            anywhere.

          <p>
            You will need a laptop, tablet, or phone with a modern browser that
            supports (Web) Bluetooth, which are currently Chrome, Firefox, and
            Edge on macOS, Windows, and Android. Sadly, Web Bluetooth is not
            supported on iOS and iPad OS devices, so there's no way to connect.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also need a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor, ideally
            in the form of a chest strap. It does not really matter which one
            you get as long as it supports BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). generic
            Bluetooth HR monitor. You can get a generic brand one on Amazon for
            approx. 30 EUR (e.g.{" "}

            Once you've configured your profile, pur your HR monitor on and
            click on "Connect to device". Pick the device from the list
            displayed by the browser to pair and connect. The list only includes
            HR monitors, so the one you see is likely the one you have.
